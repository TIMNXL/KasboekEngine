This is a personal project that I am working on. I want to create a financial overview for you personal finances. As an MVP it should have the following functions:
- Show an overview of all the transactions
- Every transactions consists of a date, a description of the transaction, and the amount of the transaction
- A user can add a transaction, both an income as an expense
- The overview shows the inital balance and the new balance

Further functions for a later stage of the project is:
- Show a graph of the growth of your savings
- Free to spend-money -> you can use a percentage of your income to use for whatever you like. However, with every expense you make, you get the option if it was from the free to spend-money. If it was, this balance will drop
- If all the free to spend-money is gone, it turns red
- If you spend more than the free to spend-money allows, it will be subtracted from the free to spend-money next month
- You can decide your own goals -> how much do you want to spend, how much do you want to save, how much do you want to invest?
